    Unique string used to identify the operation.
    The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.

    The list MUST NOT include duplicated parameters.
    A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a [name](#parameterName) and [location](#parameterIn).

    A map of possible out-of band callbacks related to the parent operation.
