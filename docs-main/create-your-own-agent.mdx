# Self-hosted

The [`BaseAgent`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/agent/base_agent.py) class that is passed into [`StreamingConversation`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/streaming_conversation.py) has the following interface:

```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_config: AgentConfig):
        self.agent_config = agent_config

    # is_interrupt is True when the human has just interrupted the bot's last response
    def respond(
        self, human_input, is_interrupt: bool = False
    ) -> tuple[Optional[str], bool]:
        raise NotImplementedError

    def generate_response(
        self, human_input, is_interrupt: bool = False
    ) -> Generator[str, None, None]:
        """Returns a generator that yields the agent's response one sentence at a time."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def update_last_bot_message_on_cut_off(self, message: str):
        """Updates the last bot message in the agent's state when the human cuts off the bot's response."""
        pass
```

You can implement this interface by subclassing `BaseAgent` to create your own agent.
[`EchoAgent`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/agent/echo_agent.py) is the simplest implementation of this.

# Hosted

Our library lets you easily host your agent so that the Vocode backend can use it to generate responses.
Users will be responsible for implementing either a `RESTfulAgent` or a `WebSocketAgent`.

## RESTful Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `RESTfulAgent` that just echoes back whatever
input it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `RESTfulAgentOutput` return value.
The `conversation_id` parameter lets you store state about a single conversation across multiple calls.

```python
from vocode.streaming.user_implemented_agent.restful_agent import RESTfulAgent
from vocode.streaming.models.agent import RESTfulAgentOutput, RESTfulAgentText, RESTfulAgentEnd

class YourAgent(RESTfulAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str, conversation_id: str) -> RESTfulAgentOutput:
        if "bye" in input:
            return RESTfulAgentEnd()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return RESTfulAgentText(response=input)  ## responds with the input received
```

## WebSocket Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `WebSocketAgent` that just echoes back whatever input
it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `WebSocketAgentMessage` return value.

```python
from vocode.streaming.user_implemented_agent.websocket_agent import WebSocketAgent
from vocode.streaming.models.agent import WebSocketAgentMessage, WebSocketAgentTextMessage, WebSocketAgentStopMessage

class YourAgent(WebSocketAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str, conversation_id: str) -> WebSocketAgentMessage:
        if "bye" in input:
            return WebSocketAgentStopMessage()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return WebSocketAgentTextMessage.from_text(input)  ## responds with the input received
```

## Run your agent

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = YourAgent()
    agent.run(port=3000)
```

This sets up a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with either a POST endpoint or a websocket route at `/respond`.
We'll use this in the next step.

## Setting up your `AgentConfig`

Now that your agent is running, you'll need to host it somewhere so that the Vocode backend can hit it.
There are a variety of options to do this, here we'll describe using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) since it's the quickest. [Replit](https://replit.com/) is also a great option for this.

```bash
# make sure the agent from the last step is running
ngrok http 3000
```

```python
...
agent_config=RESTfulUserImplementedAgentConfig(
    respond=RESTfulUserImplementedAgentConfig.EndpointConfig(
        url="<your ngrok url tunneling to localhost:3000>/respond",
    )
)
...
```
