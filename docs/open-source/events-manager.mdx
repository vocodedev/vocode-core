## What is the Events Manager

The Events Manager is a class designed to facilitate asynchronous handling of events in the application. It allows for non-blocking actions on events, such as processing transcripts, managing phone calls, and other tasks. The main components of the Events Manager are the `EventsManager` class and several `Event` subclasses representing various event types.

## EventsManager Class

The `EventsManager` class is responsible for managing the event queue and handling events asynchronously. The class provides methods for publishing events, starting the event loop, handling events, and ending the event loop.

### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, subscriptions: List[EventType] = []):
    self.queue = asyncio.Queue()
    self.subscriptions = set(subscriptions)
    self.active = False
```

The `EventsManager` constructor accepts an optional list of `EventType` subscriptions. By default, it initializes an empty set of subscriptions, an asynchronous queue, and sets the `active` attribute to `False`.

### Publishing Events

```python
def publish_event(self, event: Event):
    if event.type in self.subscriptions:
        self.queue.put_nowait(event)
```

The `publish_event` method takes an `Event` object as input and adds it to the queue if its type is in the set of subscribed event types.

### Starting the Event Loop

```python
async def start(self):
    self.active = True
    while self.active:
        try:
            event: Event = await self.queue.get()
        except asyncio.QueueEmpty:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.handle_event(event)
```

## Current Event Types

The current event types include:

1. `TRANSCRIPT`: Indicates a partial transcript for the conversation has been received.
2. `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE`: Indicates the transcript is complete (ie conversation has ended).
3. `PHONE_CALL_CONNECTED`: Indicates a phone call has been connected.
4. `PHONE_CALL_ENDED`: Indicates a phone call has ended.
5. `RECORDING`: (Vonage Only) Indicates a secure URL containing a recording of the call is available. Requires `recording=true` in `VonageConfig`.

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how the `EventsManager` class can be used to consume the `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE` event and save the transcript to a file using the `add_transcript` method:

```python
import logging
from fastapi import FastAPI
from vocode.streaming.models.events import Event, EventType, TranscriptCompleteEvent
from vocode.streaming.utils import events_manager
from call_transcript_utils import add_transcript

app = FastAPI(docs_url=None)

logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

class CustomEventsManager(events_manager.EventsManager):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(subscriptions=[EventType.TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE])

    def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        if event.type == EventType.TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE:
            transcript_complete_event = typing.cast(TranscriptCompleteEvent, event)
            add_transcript(
                transcript_complete_event.conversation_id,
                transcript_complete_event.transcript,
            )

events_manager_instance = CustomEventsManager()
await events_manager_instance.start()
```

In this example, a custom `EventsManager` subclass is created with a subscription to the `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE` event. The `handle_event` method is overridden to save the transcript to a file using the `add_transcript` method when the `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE` event is received.
