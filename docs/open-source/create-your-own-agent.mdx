# Self-hosted

You can subclass a [`RespondAgent`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/agent/base_agent.py#L140) to create a simple agent that can be passed into [`StreamingConversation`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/streaming_conversation.py) has the following interface:

Here's one that responds with the same message no matter what is said to it:

```python
class BrokenRecordAgentConfig(AgentConfig, type="agent_broken_record"):
    message: str


class BrokenRecordAgent(RespondAgent[BrokenRecordAgentConfig]):

    # is_interrupt is True when the human has just interrupted the bot's last response
    def respond(
        self, human_input, is_interrupt: bool = False
    ) -> tuple[Optional[str], bool]:
        return self.agent_config.message

    def generate_response(
        self, human_input, is_interrupt: bool = False
    ) -> Generator[str, None, None]:
        """Returns a generator that yields the agent's response one sentence at a time."""
        yield self.agent_config.message
```

See [our other agent implementations](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/tree/main/vocode/streaming/agent) for more guidance!

# Hosted (deprecated)

NOTE: The hosted `RESTfulAgent` is being deprecated.

Our library lets you easily host your agent so that the Vocode backend can use it to generate responses.
Users will be responsible for implementing a `RESTfulAgent`.

## RESTful Implementation (deprecated)

Here is an example implementation of a `RESTfulAgent` that just echoes back whatever
input it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `RESTfulAgentOutput` return value.
The `conversation_id` parameter lets you store state about a single conversation across multiple calls.

```python
from vocode.streaming.user_implemented_agent.restful_agent import RESTfulAgent
from vocode.streaming.models.agent import RESTfulAgentOutput, RESTfulAgentText, RESTfulAgentEnd

class YourAgent(RESTfulAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str, conversation_id: str) -> RESTfulAgentOutput:
        if "bye" in input:
            return RESTfulAgentEnd()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return RESTfulAgentText(response=input)  ## responds with the input received
```

## Run your agent

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = YourAgent()
    agent.run(port=3000)
```

This sets up a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with either a POST endpoint or a websocket route at `/respond`.
We'll use this in the next step.

## Setting up your `AgentConfig`

Now that your agent is running, you'll need to host it somewhere so that the Vocode backend can hit it.
There are a variety of options to do this, here we'll describe using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) since it's the quickest. [Replit](https://replit.com/) is also a great option for this.

```bash
# make sure the agent from the last step is running
ngrok http 3000
```

```python
...
agent_config=RESTfulUserImplementedAgentConfig(
    respond=RESTfulUserImplementedAgentConfig.EndpointConfig(
        url="<your ngrok url tunneling to localhost:3000>/respond",
    )
)
...
```
