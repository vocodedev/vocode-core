# 3 core pieces:

## 1. Real-time Conversation Orchestration

Vocode offers robust conversation management for both streaming and turn-based interactions.
It handles the complexities of real-time, two-way conversations (eg endpointing, handling interruptions) and
provides complete configurability for different use cases.

## 2. Integrations with all leading STT/TTS/LLM providers

With Vocode, you can easily integrate your application with top speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and large language model (LLM) providers.
This allows you to switch providers with minimal code changes.

## 3. Cross-platform support and functionality

Vocode is available cross-platform (web, telephone, mobile). You can do things like make phone calls, build websites that talk to you,
join Zoom meetings, etc.
