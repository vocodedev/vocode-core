You can set up webhooks on agents so that you can
listen to events in realtime or for post-call automation.

## Adding Webhooks

To get data from the agent during a call, you can add a webhook and assign it to listen for specific events.
Let's send a POST request to "https://example.com" every time a call ends.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vocode import AgentUpdateParams, EventType, HttpMethod, WebhookUpdateParams

new_webhook = WebhookUpdateParams(
    subscriptions=[EventType.EVENT_PHONE_CALL_ENDED],
    url="https://example.com",
    method=HttpMethod.POST,
)

number = vocode_client.numbers.update_number(
    phone_number="YOUR_NUMBER",
    inbound_agent=AgentUpdateParams(
        webhook=new_webhook,
    ),
)
```

```javascript TypeScript
import { EventType, HttpMethod } from "@vocode/vocode-api/api";

const number = await vocode.numbers.updateNumber({
  phoneNumber: "YOUR_NUMBER",
  inboundAgent: {
    webhook: {
      subscriptions: [EventType.EventPhoneCallConnected],
      url: "https://example.com",
      method: HttpMethod.Post,
    },
  },
});
```
