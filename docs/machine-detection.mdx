description: "Define the behavior of the bot when no one answers the phone"

The Vocode API allows you to configure your outbound call agent's behavior when the other end of a
phone call is an answerphone as well as subscribe to events relating to machine detection.

# Example 1: Hang up the call if it goes to voicemail

The `on_no_human_answer` parameter defines what should happen if a machine answers the phone.

```python
from vocode import CreateCallAgentParams, PromptParams

vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        prompt=PromptParams(
            content="Ask Ajay if his refrigerator is running"
        ),
    ),
    on_no_human_answer="hangup",
)
```

# Example 2: Hook into when a call goes to voicemail

If you'd like the bot to stay on the call and leave a voicemail, set `on_no_human_answer` to `"continue"`. You can
also configure a webhook to be fired when the answering machine detection status is populated.

```python
from vocode import CreateCallAgentParams, PromptParams

vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        prompt=PromptParams(
            content="Ask Ajay if his refrigerator is running"
        ),
        webhook=WebhookParams(
            url="<YOUR WEBHOOK URL>",
            subscriptions=["event_human_detection"]
        )
    ),
    on_no_human_answer="continue"
)
```

Once the call is picked up, the webhook URL configured above will get the following POST request:

```
{
  "type": "event_human_detection",
  "call_id": "<some UUID>",
  "payload": {
    "result": "no_human" # or "human"
  }
}
```

# On the horizon
