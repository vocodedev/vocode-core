title: "Do Not Call Detection"
description: "Configure whether or not to run automatic estimated Do Not Call analysis"
---

The Vocode API allows you to configure whether or not to run automatic rudimentary detection
on outbound calls as to whether or not the receiving party has indicated they would like to
be placed on a Do Not Call list. Additionally, if Do Not Call analysis was run on a call,
the result will be populated into a field on the Call object returned from the Get Call endpoint.

By default, if the `run_do_not_call_detection` argument is not supplied, Vocode will not run
Do Not Call detection.

# Example 1: Run Do Not Call detection on an outbound call, and retrieve the result

The `run_do_not_call_detection` parameter on outbound call creation defines whether
or not to run rudimentary Do Not Call analysis.

```python
from vocode import CreateCallAgentParams, PromptParams

vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        prompt=PromptParams(
            content="Ask Eliot if the sun is on today"
        ),
    ),
    run_do_not_call_detection=True
)
```

After the call has completed, we can query for calls as usual, and find the returned Call object
has the Do Not Call detection result set:

```python Python
vocode_client.calls.get_call(id="CALL_ID")
```

returning:

```json
{
  "id": "call_id",
  "to_number": "123456789",
  "from_number": "123456789",
  ...
  "do_not_call_result": true,
  ...
}
```
