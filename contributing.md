Hi there! Thank you for wanting to contribute to Vocode!

We're an open source project and are extremely open to contributions like new features,integrations, or documentation.

Please do not try to push directly to the repo unless you are a maintainer.

## 🗺️Contributing Guidelines

### 🚩GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/issues) page has all of the bugs and enhancements that we want to implement. We have labels that split them into the following categories:

- enhancements: improvements to existing features or altogether new features
- bugs: identified issues that need fixing

If you are working on an issue, please assign to yourself! And please keep issues as modular/focused as possible.

### 🙋Getting Help

We are in the process of making it as easy as possible to contribute but we completely understand if you run into issues.

Please contact us if you need help! We'd love to help + improve the process so that others don't run into similar issues. Come find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NaU4mMgcnC)!

We're working on our linting/documentation standards – and will have updates soon. We don't want that to get in your way at all.

### 🏭Release process

We release updates to Vocode on a daily basis published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vocode/).

If you submit a PR, we'd love to feature your contribution on Twitter so please include your handle in your PR/otherwise!
